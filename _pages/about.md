I am currently a master student in [Department of Economics](https://econ.duke.edu/) and [Department of Political Science](https://polisci.duke.edu/), Duke University. Before joining in Duke, I obtained my bachelor degree in arts from [School of Applied Economics, Renmin University of China](http://ae.ruc.edu.cn/) majoring in Economics and Agricultural Economics.

My research spans the comparative political economy of authoritarian institutions; environmental and natural-resource governance; causal inference and research design; and Bayesian modeling and machine learning for the social sciences.

At Duke University, I am advised by Timur Kuran, Daniel Stegemuller, Jiawei Fu and Martin D. Smith.
