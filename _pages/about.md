I am currently a master student in [Department of Economics](https://econ.duke.edu/) and [Department of Political Science](https://polisci.duke.edu/), Duke University. Before joining in Duke, I obtained my bachelor degree in arts from Renmin University of China with majors in Economics and Agricultural Economics.

My Research interest includes Political Economy of Natural Resource, Environment and Health with a focus on Authoritarian regimes. Besides, I am also interested in Political Methodology with a focus on Causal Inference, Bayesian Models and Machine Learning for Social Science.
